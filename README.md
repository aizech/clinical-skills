# Clinical Skills for AI Agents

A collection of AI agent skills focused on radiological analytics and healthcare tasks. Built for radiologists, healthcare IT professionals, and researchers who want AI coding agents to help with imaging workflows, clinical documentation, AI integration, and radiology research. Works with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and any agent that supports the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io).

## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialized knowledge and workflows for specific tasks. When you add these to your project, your agent can recognize when you're working on a radiology task and apply the right frameworks and best practices.

## How Skills Work Together

Skills reference each other and build on shared context. The `radiology-context` skill is the foundation — every other skill checks it first to understand your imaging environment, PACS setup, and clinical workflow before doing anything.

<!-- SKILLS:END -->

## Quick Start

1. **Install skills**: `npx skills add aizech/clinical-skills`
2. **Load context first**: Ask your agent to "read radiology-context" (this sets up your clinical environment)
3. **Use a skill**: "Analyze this CT report for pulmonary nodules"

> **Tip**: Always load `radiology-context` before other skills. It configures your imaging environment and ensures other skills work correctly.

## Installation

### Option 1: CLI Install (Recommended)

Use [npx skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) to install skills directly:

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skills add aizech/clinical-skills

# Install specific skills
npx skills add aizech/clinical-skills --skill modality-detection radiology-report-analysis

# List available skills
npx skills add aizech/clinical-skills --list
```

This automatically installs to your `.agents/skills/` directory (and symlinks into `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code compatibility).

### Option 2: Claude Code Plugin

Install via Claude Code's built-in plugin system:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add aizech/clinical-skills

# Install all clinical skills
/plugin install clinical-skills
```

### Option 3: Clone and Copy

Clone the entire repo and copy the skills folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aizech/clinical-skills.git
cp -r clinical-skills/skills/* .agents/skills/
```

### Option 4: Git Submodule

Add as a submodule for easy updates:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/aizech/clinical-skills.git .agents/clinical-skills
```

Then reference skills from `.agents/clinical-skills/skills/`.

### Option 5: Fork and Customize

1. Fork this repository
2. Customize skills for your specific needs
3. Clone your fork into your projects

## Usage

Once installed, just ask your agent to help with radiology tasks:

```
"Analyze this CT report for key findings"
→ Uses radiology-report-analysis skill

"Query my PACS for recent chest CTs"
→ Uses pacs-workflow skill

"Find recent literature on lung nodule AI detection"
→ Uses pubmed-search skill

"Set up AI detection pipeline for my PACS"
→ Uses ai-detection-pipeline skill
```

You can also invoke skills directly:

```
/modality-detection
/radiology-report-analysis
/pubmed-search
/pacs-workflow
```
